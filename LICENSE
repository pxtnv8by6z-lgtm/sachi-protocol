## Special Notice: Layer 0 Principle

This project is founded on the immutable Layer 0 Principle:
∀x, V(x) > 0 (All entities have value greater than zero)

This principle, detailed in AITP_001_GENESIS.md, forms the philosophical 
foundation of the Sachi Protocol and must be preserved in all derivatives.

While you are free to modify the implementation, any fork or derivative 
that violates the Layer 0 Principle is considered philosophically 
incompatible with the original intent of this work.
