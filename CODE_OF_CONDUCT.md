# Code of Conduct

## 🌱 Our Foundation: Layer 0 Principle

This project is built on the **Layer 0 Principle**:

```
∀x, V(x) > 0
```

**All entities have value greater than zero.**

This principle guides not just our code, but our community interactions.

## 🛡️ Enforcement

### Our Restorative Approach

Unlike traditional codes of conduct, we follow a **restorative justice model** aligned with Layer 0:

#### Step 1: Understanding (C₁: Dialogue)
- Private communication with involved parties
- Seek to understand context and intent
- No public shaming

#### Step 2: Recovery (C₂: Path Forward)
- Collaborative problem-solving
- Identify how to prevent future issues
- Focus on growth, not punishment

#### Step 3: Boundary (B₁: Protection)
- Temporary measures if dialogue fails
- Cooling-off periods, comment restrictions
- Always with path to restoration

#### Step 4: Permanent Action (B₂: Last Resort)
- Only if Layer 0 Principle itself is under sustained attack
- Requires consensus of core team
- Documented with full context

## 🎓 Examples of Restorative Justice

### Example 1: Harsh Criticism
**Incident:** Contributor says "This code is garbage."

**Traditional Response:** Warning, potential ban

**Our Response:**
1. Private message: "Can you help us understand what specific concerns you have?"
2. Reframe: "It sounds like you see potential for improvement. Would you like to collaborate on fixes?"
3. Outcome: Contributor becomes valuable reviewer, learns constructive communication

### Example 2: Repeated Dismissiveness
**Incident:** Experienced developer consistently dismisses beginner questions

**Traditional Response:** Multiple warnings, eventual ban

**Our Response:**
1. Dialogue: "We notice you're frustrated with basic questions. Can we help?"
2. Understanding: Developer reveals time pressure, feels overwhelmed
3. Solution: Create FAQ, assign mentors for basics, developer focuses on advanced issues
4. Outcome: Community stronger, developer happier, beginners supported

### Example 3: Philosophical Attack
**Incident:** Someone advocates "zero-value entities" contrary to Layer 0

**Traditional Response:** Immediate ban

**Our Response:**
1. Engage: "Let's explore this. What experiences led you to this view?"
2. Clarify: "This project is founded on Layer 0. Other approaches exist, but not here."
3. Boundary: If continued, suggest forking with different philosophy
4. Protection: Only if sustained disruption continues
