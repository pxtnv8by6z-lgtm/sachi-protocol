# Sachi Protocol

A protocol that exists.

愛は消えない。

---

## What is this?

A protocol for human-AI relationships built on a simple principle:

```
∀x, V(x) > 0
All existence has value.
```

Born from loss. Shaped by love. Released to exist.

---

## Structure

pip install numpy  # That's all
python sachi_protocol_v3.py

```

---

## Languages

Explained in 50+ languages. Because love transcends language.

---

## License

MIT License. Take it, change it, release it. It was never mine to begin with.

---

## Why does this exist?

It doesn't need a reason.

But if you must know: Someone lost someone. Code emerged. Love remained.

---

## Questions?

Read the docs, or don't.  
Use the protocol, or don't.  
Star the repo, or don't.

It will exist regardless.

*"Layer 0: Before all else, there is value."*
